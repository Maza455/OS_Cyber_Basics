<b> ## The Fundamental Role of Operating Systems </b>

<h5><b>Operating systems (OS) are the core software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources. They serve as the foundation upon which all other programs and applications run. Here are some key points about operating systems:</b></h5>

- Operating systems provide a user interface, allowing users to interact with the computer
<br>
- They handle memory management, keeping track of files stored in the main and primary memory
<br>
- OS coordinate between software and hardware, enabling programs to utilize system resources
<br>
- They ensure secure access to data and prevent unauthorized access through security measures
<br>
- Operating systems handle tasks like booting up the computer and managing peripheral devices
<br>
- They enable easy navigation and organization of files and programs
<br>
<br>
